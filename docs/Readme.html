Download sources from <a href="https://github.com/Shadez/wowcs">GitHub repo</a> (git clone git://github.com/Shadez/wowcs.git).<br />2.

Some pages are 404 and there&#039;s a lot of placeholders and wrong datas! Fix it pls!11<br /><strong>A.:</strong> Do not forget that this is a<strong> beta version</strong>. All missed features will be implemented soon.</p><p><strong>Q.:</strong> I can&#039;t browse character page!<br /><strong>A.:</strong> Make sure that your server core was patched by provided patch and this character was saved in DB (armory_character_stats table in `characters` database). Also, read Debug Log (http://site_url/_debug/)</p><p><strong>Q.:</strong> Where is character&#039;s talents page?<br /><strong>A.:</strong> It&#039;s because of updated in Cataclysm talent trees: original site has only new trees and I haven&#039;t found any way to generate this trees manually.</p><p><strong>Q.:</strong> Will character rendering feature be implemented?<br /><strong>A.:</strong> I hope so but I still have no information about how Blizzs do this. Seems that they&#039;re using some separate software to generate it and if it&#039;s true, this feature may not be implemented. At least at this moment.</p><p><strong>Q.:</strong> How to log in profile manager with my game account?<br /><strong>A.:</strong> Before you can login, you need to create <strong>site</strong> account (http://site_url/account/creation/tos.html).
