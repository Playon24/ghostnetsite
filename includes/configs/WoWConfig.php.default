/**
 * How works *.local config files?
 *  
 * There is two same config files for Database and WoWCS with only one difference:
 * In *.local.php set your configuration for your localhost server where you are testing
 * your changes. In files without .local suffix set your configuration to your public server.
 * This is usefull if your configurations as dblogin, dbpass, dbname, etc.. are different
 * on your test and public servers. All 4 files (DatabaseConfig.php, DatabaseConfig.local.php,
 * WoWConfig.php and WoWConfig.local.php) can exists on both your servers configuration dirs,
 * but for property works there is one file which must be created only in public server
 * configuration dir. This file name is ".public" and it is not included.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT:
 * 1) create file named ".public" in "WOW_DIRECTORY./includes/configs/" ONLY in your public server, NOT in localhost
